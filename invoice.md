_This diagram illustrates the layered architecture:_

- API Gateway routes requests
- InvoiceController handles HTTP requests
- Business logic sits in InvoiceService
- Data access is handled by InvoiceRepository
- Data is persisted to a MySQL database
- The service is registered with Eureka for discovery
