## Overview
The Invoice and Billing Service is a Spring Boot microservice within the Vehicle Management System. It handles invoice generation, payment tracking, and PDF downloads. It communicates with other services like Booking and Service Center via Feign Clients and is registered with Eureka for service discovery.

## Features

- Generate invoices based on bookings and service types
- Track payment status
- Download invoice as PDF
- Integrate with Booking and Service Center services
- Registered with Eureka Discovery
- Routed via API Gateway

_This diagram illustrates the layered architecture:_

- API Gateway routes requests
- InvoiceController handles HTTP requests
- Business logic sits in InvoiceService
- Data access is handled by InvoiceRepository
- Data is persisted to a MySQL database
- The service is registered with Eureka for discovery
